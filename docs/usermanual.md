## Screenshots

With audian you can easily generate screenshots of interesting
snippets of the data and you can use screenshot files to navigate to
these snippets later on.

Pressing `Ctrl + Alt + S` takes a screen shot of the audian window . A
file dialog pops up that allows you to set the name of the resulting
png file. The default file name for the screenshot file is
`screenshot.png`.  You may change the file name to any name you want
to describe the screenshot. But it needs to be a PNG file.

Audian stores the name and position of the displayed data file in the
PNG file's metadata.


### Go to the position shown in a screenshot file

If you drag a screenshot file onto the audian window, then audian
moves the displayed window to the position shown in the
screenshot. The window position is taken from the screenshot's
metadata.
